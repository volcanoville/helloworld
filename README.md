Beginning Before You Begin

The first step in any new endeavor is often a mis-step. In fact, the first few steps are generally missteps. Let’s say that any time you try something you haven’t tried before, you’ll probably trip over your shoes and fall down the basement stairs.

What you do AFTER that is usually regain your bearings and start again, with a little bit of a clearer picture of what you’re trying to accomplish and what the very basic rudiments are that you’ll require to execute that accomplishment. So, with that in mind, I’ve started this tumblr to document myself tumbling headfirst into the darkness as I attempt to learn to program. Along the way, I’ll probably fuck up hilariously; I promise not to skimp on the details. I might even accidentally destroy a computer or two! Sky’s the limit.

I’m starting the edX “CS101.1x Introduction to Computer Programming” MOOC in a couple days; expect some updates in the run-up to my first day wherein I try to install developer tools and git and a bunch of shit that I don’t know what it does. Should be exciting.  Will I have a functioning computer by the time the class starts?  Let’s find out together.
